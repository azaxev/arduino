Had this sitting in my work folder and dont remember if it was used or not,
but perhaps someday I may need it so here it goes into my assorted arduino
sketch repository.

Original code from Terry King from http://terryking.us/arduino-testing.htm

Removed dependency on LED abstraction library

Removed floating point

A2D_Delay = 1ms, serial baudrate = 115200, removed extra delays

Not a production level sketch, just a starting point
